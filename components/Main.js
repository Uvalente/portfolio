        <p>After many years surrounded by hobs and pots, I've hung up my knives and dust off my childhood dream.</p>
        <p>
          Equipped with the same drive and perseverance that allowed me to rise and shine in the culinary world, I embarked on countless hours of self-study and self-improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I honed my skills in a well-known coding boot-camp, absorbed the agile mentality, and thrived in pair programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I admit it wasn't always an easy road, however, the feeling of developing an idea makes up for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that coding is more than solving a problem or following instructions, it is also about being creative and look out for new perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          During these months, I had the opportunity to work on a few personal and collaborative projects and I am now looking for new exciting and challenging proposals that will boost my expertise and technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to learn more about myself and my experience, feel free to reach out or have a look at my newest projects.
