Fully responsive single page app where you can create your cooking recipes book, and browse through other users’ recipes.<br>
I conceptualized this project from beginning to end.<br>
After creating high-level user stories to outline the main functionalities, I employed wireframe diagrams to sketch the user interface and implemented it with a mobile first design.<br><br>
The TDD process applied reduced bugs and improved the development workflow.<br>
Once a feature is complete, it’s merged with the production branch and automatically deployed on Heroku.
