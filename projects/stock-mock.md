If you are interested in stocks trading but scared of losing all your savings, this is your lucky day!<br>
Start fake buying and fake selling shares of your favorite company and become a fake millionaire!
<br><br>
This is a Flask web application developed with a TDD approach using pytest.<br>
I employed the Application Factory pattern to facilitate testing, and Blueprint to organize the app and separate concerns.<br>
Bootstrap is being used to style the app and achieve a responsive design.
