Social media web app where as a user you can post, comment or like on yours or other people’s wall.<br>
I personally implemented OAuth registration and a live chat using Rails Action Cable.<br><br>
Developed following client requirements, we focused on delivery the best result in the shortest timespan, and fluidly reacted to changes in specification.<br>
We used Travis Continuous Integration for automatic testing, linting and deploying, and practised code reviews on pull requests.
