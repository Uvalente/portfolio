JavaScript SPA scrolling platform game.<br>
A user provided Mp3 file is analysed to extract tempo and amplitude, the data is then used to automatically generate a level with different obstacles.<br><br>
We developed this project in a ten days time frame, using an agile methodology and constant pair programming.<br>
A Trello board was used to manage the product backlog and select the task to be included in two days Sprints.<br>
Quick stand-up and retrospectives were conducted daily to update every member of the team on current progress and resolve blockers.
